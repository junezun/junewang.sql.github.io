 * Common syntax error: aggregate function calls cannot be nested (LINE: 3) - if you try to retrive the MAX(SUM(issued_amount)), or MIN(SUM(issued_amount)) to calculate the difference, SQL wouldn't allow you to do so
 * If you simply use MAX(issued_amount) - MIN(issued_amount) to calculate the difference, it will failed the condition of asking difference in issued amount between the month, because there're multiple record of issued_amount in each months. 
 * The first step is to group issued_amount by card_name and issued_month to get sales amount per month for each card
 * The second step is to calculate the difference between MAX sales month and MIN sales month to get the desire output

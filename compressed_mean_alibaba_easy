/* This is a very sneaky question that can really trip you up if you forget - in SQL, if you use division directly, the result will actually return a result of mode operation
 * meaning if you ONLY calculate ROUND(SUM(item_count * order_occurrences) / SUM(order_occurrences),1), the result will be '3.0' which is incorrect, because in this operation, it is using 19190 mode 4960 which will result in 3 
 * The question is assessing your knowledge about: 1. How to properly do division in SQL - by multipliying a decimal number to your calculation 2. How to round numbers 3. How to calculate mean

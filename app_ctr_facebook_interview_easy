/* The question is tesing:
 * CASE caluse in aggregated functions
 * ROUNDing numbers
 * Easy-to-make mistakes: 1. not clear with CASE WHEN syntax: when case when is being used in aggregated functions, you don't need to alias it, otherwise it will cause syntax errors.
 * 2. remember to END the CASE clause. (if not, ERROR msg: syntax error at or near ")" (LINE: 3))
